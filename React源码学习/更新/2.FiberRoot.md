# FiberRoot

> 作用:
1. 整个应用的起点
2. 包含根节点下将要挂载的目标节点信息
3. 记录整个应用更新过程中所需的各项信息(如expirationTime, callback等)

```js
type BaseFiberRootProperties = {|
  // Any additional information from the host associated with this root.
  containerInfo: any,
  // Used only by persistent updates.
  pendingChildren: any,
  // The currently active root fiber. This is the mutable root of the tree.
  current: Fiber,

  // The following priority levels are used to distinguish between 1)
  // uncommitted work, 2) uncommitted work that is suspended, and 3) uncommitted
  // work that may be unsuspended. We choose not to track each individual
  // pending level, trading granularity for performance.
  //
  // The earliest and latest priority levels that are suspended from committing.
  earliestSuspendedTime: ExpirationTime,
  latestSuspendedTime: ExpirationTime,
  // The earliest and latest priority levels that are not known to be suspended.
  earliestPendingTime: ExpirationTime,
  latestPendingTime: ExpirationTime,
  // The latest priority level that was pinged by a resolved promise and can
  // be retried.
  latestPingedTime: ExpirationTime,

  // If an error is thrown, and there are no more updates in the queue, we try
  // rendering from the root one more time, synchronously, before handling
  // the error.
  didError: boolean,

  pendingCommitExpirationTime: ExpirationTime,
  // A finished work-in-progress HostRoot that's ready to be committed.
  finishedWork: Fiber | null,
  // Timeout handle returned by setTimeout. Used to cancel a pending timeout, if
  // it's superseded by a new one.
  timeoutHandle: TimeoutHandle | NoTimeout,
  // Top context object, used by renderSubtreeIntoContainer
  context: Object | null,
  pendingContext: Object | null,
  // Determines if we should attempt to hydrate on the initial mount
  +hydrate: boolean,
  // Remaining expiration time on this root.
  // TODO: Lift this into the renderer
  nextExpirationTimeToWorkOn: ExpirationTime,
  expirationTime: ExpirationTime,
  // List of top-level batches. This list indicates whether a commit should be
  // deferred. Also contains completion callbacks.
  // TODO: Lift this into the renderer
  firstBatch: Batch | null,
  // Linked-list of roots
  nextScheduledRoot: FiberRoot | null,
|};
```

# Fiber

> 作用:
1. 每一个ReactElement对应一个Fiber对象
2. 记录节点的各种状态:
例如state中的数据更新, 是Fiber对象更新之后再对state内的属性进行重新赋值;
此外, functional Component没有this, 但由于所有的数据都是存在Fiber上的, 所以并不会影响Hooks功能使用
3. 串联整个应用形成树结构

```js
// A Fiber is work on a Component that needs to be done or was done. There can
// be more than one per component.
export type Fiber = {|
  // These first fields are conceptually members of an Instance. This used to
  // be split into a separate type and intersected with the other Fiber fields,
  // but until Flow fixes its intersection bugs, we've merged them into a
  // single type.

  // An Instance is shared between all versions of a component. We can easily
  // break this out into a separate object to avoid copying so much to the
  // alternate versions of the tree. We put this on a single object for now to
  // minimize the number of objects created during the initial render.

  // Tag identifying the type of fiber.
  tag: WorkTag,

  // Unique identifier of this child.
  key: null | string,

  // The value of element.type which is used to preserve the identity during
  // reconciliation of this child.
  elementType: any,

  // The resolved function/class/ associated with this fiber.
  type: any,

  // The local state associated with this fiber.
  stateNode: any,

  // Conceptual aliases
  // parent : Instance -> return The parent happens to be the same as the
  // return fiber since we've merged the fiber and instance.

  // Remaining fields belong to Fiber

  // The Fiber to return to after finishing processing this one.
  // This is effectively the parent, but there can be multiple parents (two)
  // so this is only the parent of the thing we're currently processing.
  // It is conceptually the same as the return address of a stack frame.

  child: Fiber | null,

  // Input is the data coming into process this fiber. Arguments. Props.
  pendingProps: any, // This type will be more specific once we overload the tag.

  // value should remain unchanged throughout the fiber's lifetime, particularly
  // before its child fibers are created.

  // Effect
  effectTag: SideEffectTag,

  // Singly linked list fast path to the next fiber with side-effects.

  // eventually have a pair. There are cases when we can clean up pairs to save
  // memory if we need to.
  alternate: Fiber | null,
